# CSS Styling: Neon Glowing Text Effect  

This CSS file applies a centered, glowing text effect to an `h1` element on a webpage.  

## Styles Applied  

### **Body**  
- Uses `display: flex` to center content both vertically and horizontally.  
- Sets the height to `100vh` to cover the full viewport.  
- Applies a black (`rgb(0, 0, 0)`) background for contrast.  

### **H1 Element**  
- Transforms text to uppercase (`text-transform: uppercase`).  
- Sets the font size to `5em` for emphasis.  
- Uses `letter-spacing: 10px` to create spacing between letters.  
- Applies a **glowing cyan effect** using multiple layers of `text-shadow`.  

## Visual Effect  
The `h1` text appears in white with a **neon cyan glow**, creating a futuristic look, especially on dark backgrounds.
